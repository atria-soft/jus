`zeus` is a Zeus ewol Âµ-service

Instructions
============

messaging engine drived by data and message based on websocket api

Start basic service engine
==========================

Start The router interface:
```
lutin -cclang -mdebug zeus-package-base?build?run%zeus-router
```

You have now multiple choice:

* Single process start:

```
#Start a single gateWay with basic with no user service associated:
lutin -cclang -mdebug zeus-package-base?build?run%zeus-gateway:--user=userName~server.org
# start service is separated process: (the user service is needed all the time ...)
lutin -cclang -mdebug zeus-package-base?build?run%zeus-launch:--srv=user
lutin -cclang -mdebug zeus-package-base?build?run%zeus-launch:--srv=picture
lutin -cclang -mdebug zeus-package-base?build?run%zeus-launch:--srv=video
```

* Start your gateway with the service in a single process (faster: No inter-process messaging)

```
lutin -cclang -mdebug zeus-package-base?build?run%zeus-gateway:--user=userName~server.org:--srv=user:--srv=picture:--srv=video
```
