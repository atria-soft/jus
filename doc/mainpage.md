==============

ZEUS, or Zeus Ewol micro-service. It is a developement to create c++ microservice compatible with the web generic ineterface.

My objective are:
  - create a facebook, tweeter, snapsher heberged on my own server and not dependent on the "big enterprise" that I do not know what they do on my "PERSONAL DATA"
  - Have a real sharing on personal picture and video with the circle I want
  - Create a separate Front end that can acces on an other service that is own on an other server ==> generic API ==> 1 Front end
  - shared My phone and personal data with all my friend and family ==> ne need to update the information, this is automatic...
